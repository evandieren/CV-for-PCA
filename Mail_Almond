Mail to Almond:

Dear Almond,

As we agreed in the exercise last Friday, we will send you the points that we are not a 100% sure, before starting analyzing the results of our simulation study.

Wrong PCA Method:
We tried to work in the feedback you gave us with adding the variance by cutting off the p-r smalles eigenvalues. However we still run into some troubles.
* Why is that?

Matrix Completion Method:
* Is the way we implemented correct?
* What would be the best convergence measure in this case?
* To what extend is a cross validation already performed in the Algorithm. Or should we implent this algorithms, by enhancing it with a for-loop that computes the error when leaving a certain amount of informations.

KDE Approach:
* Is the way we implemented correct?

When testing with the two latter with a modified data set truncated to rank r. We noticed that the Matrix Complemention reacts highly sensitive to the choosen signal-to-noise ratio. Is that supposed to be? Obviously this would depend whether we implemented them correctly.

Good luck for the conference on Tuesday!
